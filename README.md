# cs2-3DS
Play cs2-based VNs on your 3DS!

Basically a means to play some great VNs on your 3DS. Still in its early development stage.

What I have done:
    -Read text from CST scene script files
    -Read script from user interface FES files
    -Extract INT archives
    -Read HG3 images

To-do list:
    -Write an interpreter for the scripts (any help with that would be gladly taken)
    -Audio capabilities (should not be really hard to implement)
