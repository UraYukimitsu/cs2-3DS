# cs2-3DS
Play cs2-based VNs on your 3DS!

Basically a means to play some great VNs on your 3DS. Still in its early development stage.

What I have done:

    - [x] Read text from CST scene script files
    
    - [x] Read script from user interface FES files
    
    - [x] Extract INT archives
    
    - [x] Read HG3 images
    

To-do list:

    - [ ] Write an interpreter for the scripts (any help with that would be gladly taken)
    
    - [ ] Audio capabilities (should not be really hard to implement)
